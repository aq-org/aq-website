# Announcement
Due to the increasing development work of `AQ`, the lack of professional translators and the unsatisfactory translation results, the multi-language version of `AQ official website` will be temporarily suspended from real-time maintenance from now on. Only `English` and `Chinese` are supported. </br>

But this does not mean that we will no longer provide translations. It is just that there will be a difference in the provision of multi-language translations. For versions other than Chinese and English, they will be provided through specific maintenance. Compared with the real-time updates of Chinese and English, the multi-language version will be delayed. </br>

At the same time, this will greatly speed up our research and development work on `AQ`. Since the current translation is still based on external machine translation, there is a lack of manpower and it is impossible to do a comprehensive manual review. Therefore, if you find any problems with the translation content, please contact us in time. The official `Github`, `X`, `Facebook` and `Mailbox` are always open. But we recommend that you submit issues on `Github` to get faster support. </br>

If you are interested in the translation or development work of `AQ`, please feel free to contact us. The contact information is the same as above. This will help `AQ` develop better. </br>

Thank you for your understanding and support. </br>
